Notes for February 14, 2018

# Data Publishing  

## Reources

* Journal of Cultural Analytics	www.cultural analytics.org	VERY New – 18 months & rolling publication dates; 2 sets published; good for citations, how fix versioning 
* Journal of Open Humanities Data – peer reviewed as are all but it’s 5 years old so not great
* re3data.org is Registry of Research Data Repositories. Shows less advanced data sharing practices in social science & humanities; 

	
## Where to Look for Data sets
	
  * Harvard’s Dataverse
	* Zenodo (subject agnostic); Adam asks about how best to use?  Where’s the file from? Will four data live in ## locations? JCA peer reviews both your article & your dataset, then you publish data; Does Github compete with these?  VIO says leave it open but will that hurt you if it’s on GitHub & 1 other?  VIO thinks you get a 2nd DOI after the peer review.
	*Figshare
	
 
 * Institutional Repositories (Discover Archive)  (open access w/ Vandy affiliation) and Elisabeth’s area. Staff, Students & Faculty, any file type. Moving towards mediated uploads by ES; all are non-exclusive license. NO copyright claimed so no need for 2nd version of DOI
